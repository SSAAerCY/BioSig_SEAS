This is a collection of codes you need to run to enable the simulation

Run this code to generate the basic inputs 

Note that the full cross section generation will take days to complete,
please start with selecting the generation of a few molecules

example.db contains 1 molecule: H2O and enable you to check that the code is working
demo.db contains 10 molecules with rough resolution to demonstrate some capabilities of the code
simulation.db You will need to generate your own in order to run the full capability of the code

For developers:
    Please DO NOT git add the input folder or any generated data
